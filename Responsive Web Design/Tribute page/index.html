        <h3>Who is bill gates?</h3>
        <p class="info">
          Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner Paul
          Allen founded and built the world's largest software business,
          Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy
          and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of
          the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that
          he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable
          work at his foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
        </p>
        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p class="info">
          Early Life Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955,
          in Seattle, Washington. Gates grew up in an upper-middle-class family
          with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their
          father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law
          student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an
          athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively
          involved in student affairs and leadership.
        </p>

        <p class="info">
          The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children
          were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Gates
          showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family
          athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished
          in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at
          Monopoly.
        </p>

        <p class="info">
          Gates had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a
          brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the
          children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also
          served on several corporate boards, including those of the First
          Interstate Bank in Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United
          Way and International Business Machines (IBM). She would often take
          Gates along when she volunteered in schools and at community
          organizations.
